# Amazons
Amazons (or Game of the Amazons) is a combinatorial game that was invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas. It is played on a 10 by 10 board and combines elements of chess (queen moves specifically) with the idea of removing squares from play, until one of the two players is unable to move and must concede. My intention with this project is to develop a program to allow users to play the game of Amazons, as well as develop different AIs that will play using a variety of strategies. The AIs include a combinatorial game theory implementation, with an endgame database optimisation, a monte-carlo tree search, a heuristic-based implementation, as well as a random choice AI.
